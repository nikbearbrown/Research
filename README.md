# Agentic AI Research Repository

This repository contains a collection of research papers exploring various aspects of AI agents and agentic AI systems, with a focus on conceptual frameworks, applications, challenges, and future directions.

## üìÅ Conceptual Frameworks

Papers in this directory establish foundational conceptual frameworks for understanding AI agents and agentic AI systems.

### [AI Agents vs. Agentic AI: A Conceptual Typology](/conceptual-frameworks/AI_Agents_vs_Agentic_AI.md)

This comprehensive review critically distinguishes between AI Agents and Agentic AI, offering a structured conceptual typology to clarify their divergent design philosophies and capabilities. It characterizes AI Agents as modular systems for narrow, task-specific automation, while positioning Agentic AI as a paradigmatic shift involving multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and orchestrated autonomy. The paper presents a comparative analysis across architectural evolution, operational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, and examines applications and challenges in both paradigms.

**Key Contributions:**
- Establishes ideal types of AI Agents and Agentic AI along a spectrum rather than as discrete categories
- Provides detailed comparison tables across multiple dimensions including goal flexibility, memory use, and coordination strategies
- Maps real-world applications to theoretical frameworks
- Identifies key challenges and limitations specific to each agent type

### [AI Agents vs. Agentic AI: Conceptual Framework, Applications and Tradeoffs](/conceptual-frameworks/ai-agents-vs-agentic-ai.md)

A more concise treatment of the distinction between AI Agents and Agentic AI systems, focusing on practical applications and tradeoffs. This paper provides a streamlined framework for understanding the evolution from standalone LLMs to increasingly autonomous frameworks, with particular attention to real-world implementation considerations.

**Key Contributions:**
- Clear delineation of core characteristics for both paradigms
- Practical comparison of architectural and operational differences
- Focused analysis of application domains with specific examples
- Targeted discussion of challenges and potential solutions

### [Beyond Simulation: Agentic AI and the Future of Human Self-Understanding](/conceptual-frameworks/agentic-ai-humanities.md)

This paper examines the impact of agentic AI systems on human self-conception and educational frameworks, particularly in humanities education. It argues that multi-agent AI architectures serve as epistemic mirrors that clarify the boundaries between simulation and authentic human experience, potentially catalyzing a renaissance in humanistic education.

**Key Contributions:**
- Analysis of how AI agents affect human self-understanding and educational practices
- Empirical studies of human-AI collaborative exchanges in educational settings
- Identification of the "intellectual mirror" effect in human-AI interaction
- Framework for "post-simulation humanities" that embraces AI as a transformative instrument

## üìÅ Applications and Use Cases

Papers in this directory explore specific applications and use cases of agentic AI systems across different domains.

### [CANCER-COGNITOME: An Interdisciplinary Framework of AI Agents for Hypothesis Generation and Experimental Design in Cancer Research](/applications/cancer-ai-research.md)

This paper introduces CANCER-COGNITOME, a multi-agent AI framework designed to collaborate with human researchers to generate novel cancer research hypotheses and design experimental validation plans. The system integrates specialized agents with complementary expertise across molecular biology, clinical oncology, pharmacology, and experimental design.

**Key Contributions:**
- Novel multi-agent architecture for scientific hypothesis generation
- Collaborative methodology for human-AI research partnerships
- Detailed case studies on pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and Barrett's esophagus
- Evaluation framework for assessing hypothesis quality and experimental design
- Ethical considerations for AI in scientific discovery

## üìÅ Challenges and Limitations

Papers in this directory analyze specific challenges and limitations in current agentic AI systems.

### [The Causal Reasoning Gap in Modern AI Agents: Limitations, Implications, and Pathways Forward](/challenges/causal-reasoning-research.md)

This paper examines the foundational limitation of modern AI systems regarding causal understanding and reasoning. It analyzes how current Large Language Models (LLMs), which drive most contemporary AI agents, excel at pattern recognition and statistical correlation but lack genuine causal modeling capabilities.

**Key Contributions:**
- Analysis of the distinction between statistical correlation and causal understanding in AI systems
- Case studies of causal reasoning failures in healthcare, autonomous driving, and financial domains
- Theoretical explanations for why current AI architectures struggle with causality
- Survey of emerging approaches to instill causal reasoning capabilities in AI systems
- Implications for deployment and research priorities

### [The Opacity Problem: Trust, Explainability, and Verification Challenges in Multi-Agent AI Systems](/challenges/trust-explainability-verification.md)

This paper examines how Agentic AI systems introduce unprecedented complexity in system explainability and verification. It analyzes the layered opacity that emerges when multiple agents with independent memory systems, reasoning processes, and objectives interact through loosely defined communication protocols.

**Key Contributions:**
- Comprehensive analysis of structural and emergent sources of opacity in multi-agent systems
- Case studies across healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and financial trading
- Review of current approaches to multi-agent explainability
- Detailed examination of verification challenges in distributed AI systems
- Research agenda for improving transparency and trustworthiness

## üìÅ Supplementary Materials

### [Will the Humanities Survive Artificial Intelligence?](/supplementary/humanities-ai-essay.md)

This reflective essay examines the impact of AI on humanities education, arguing that while AI may disrupt traditional approaches to humanities scholarship, it also offers an opportunity to return to deeper questions of human experience and meaning that remain beyond algorithmic simulation.

**Key Insights:**
- Describes firsthand experiences of integrating AI into university teaching
- Analyzes student engagement with AI systems in humanities education
- Proposes that AI may help clarify what remains uniquely human
- Suggests a shift from knowledge production to experiential understanding in humanities education

## Research Themes

Across these papers, several key research themes emerge:

1. **Architectural Evolution**: The progression from single-agent to multi-agent systems, with corresponding changes in capabilities, applications, and challenges.

2. **Transparency and Explainability**: The increasing opacity challenges as AI systems become more distributed and complex.

3. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Frameworks and methodologies for effective partnerships between humans and AI systems.

4. **Limitations and Boundaries**: Fundamental constraints in current AI approaches, particularly regarding causal understanding and verification.

5. **Philosophical Implications**: How advances in AI technology inform our understanding of human cognition, creativity, and consciousness.

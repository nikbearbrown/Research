# Citation Checker Project Progress Analysis

This document analyzes the current progress of the Citation Checker project against the comprehensive requirements outlined in the "Citation Checker for LLM Validation" requirements document.

## Current Project State

The current implementation of the Citation Checker project includes:

1. **Citation Parsing**: A functional APA citation parser that can extract and parse citations from text
2. **Author Name Processing**: Robust handling of author names in various formats
3. **Citation Extraction**: Ability to identify and extract citations from larger texts
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Basic confidence scoring for parsed citations
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation including README, technical docs, user guide, and contribution guidelines
6. **Testing**: A complete test suite with all tests passing

## Summary of Progress

The current project represents approximately **15-20%** of the total scope outlined in the requirements document. It has successfully completed:

1. The foundation for the citation parsing system
2. A robust APA citation parser
3. Basic confidence scoring
4. Comprehensive documentation for the current functionality
5. A solid test suite for the implemented components

The project is aligned with the early stages (Weeks 1-2) of the development plan, having established the foundation and implemented core citation parsing for the APA format.

## Next Steps

Based on the requirements and current progress, the recommended next steps are:

1. **Expand Citation Parsing**:
   - Implement parsers for additional citation formats (MLA, Chicago, etc.)
   - Add support for footnotes, endnotes, and hyperlinks

2. **Begin Source Retrieval**:
   - Develop web crawling functionality
   - Implement academic API connectors
   - Build content extraction system

3. **Start Verification Engine**:
   - Implement text comparison algorithms
   - Develop semantic similarity analysis
   - Create enhanced confidence scoring system

4. **Develop Reporting System**:
   - Create detailed report templates
   - Implement visualization components
   - Build export functionality

5. **Add User Interface**:
   - Develop web dashboard
   - Implement API endpoints
   - Create integration plugins

The current progress provides a solid foundation for these next steps, particularly with the well-documented and tested citation parsing functionality.

# 📚 Citation Checker

Citation Checker is a system designed to automatically verify the accuracy, relevance, and consistency of citations in academic texts. It helps researchers, editors, and reviewers maintain scholarly integrity by detecting citation errors, broken references, and context mismatches using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## 🧾 Features

- ✅ Detects incorrect citations
- 🔍 Verifies citation context and relevance
- 📎 Checks source availability and integrity
- 📖 Supports multiple citation formats (APA, MLA, Chicago, IEEE)
- 🧠 Uses NLP to evaluate semantic context

## 📘 Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Citation Verification** | The process of checking if a citation correctly refers to a valid, intended source. |
| **Reference Parsing** | Extracting structured information (e.g., title, authors, year) from citation strings. |
| **Semantic Matching** | Comparing the meaning/context of a cited sentence to the actual source to verify accuracy. |
| **Broken Reference** | A reference that cannot be resolved or linked to a valid source. |
| **Citation Context** | The text surrounding a citation, used to determine whether the citation is semantically appropriate. |
| **Ground Truth** | Verified data used to evaluate or train citation checkers. |
| **False Positive** | A citation flagged as incorrect, though it is actually correct. |
| **False Negative** | A citation that is incorrect but not flagged by the system. |
| **Gold Standard Dataset** | A benchmark dataset with human-validated citation correctness. |
| **DOI** | Digital Object Identifier, a unique alphanumeric string assigned to a publication. |

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### 1. **What is the purpose of a citation checker?**
To automatically detect citation errors in academic writing and ensure sources are cited correctly and meaningfully.

### 2. **How does it work?**
It uses NLP and machine learning models to analyze both the citation and the source document, comparing semantic meaning and structure.

### 3. **Can it detect fake or fabricated citations?**
Yes. It flags references that don’t exist in known databases or that don’t match the context of the citation.

### 4. **What citation styles are supported?**
Most standard formats like APA, MLA, Chicago, IEEE, and custom BibTeX formats.

### 5. **Is human review still needed?**
Yes, especially for edge cases. The system is designed to assist, not replace, human judgment.

### 6. **Does it work with non-English sources?**
Support for multilingual sources is in progress. Current implementation primarily supports English.

### 7. **How accurate is it?**
Accuracy depends on training data and model complexity. Most systems report over 80% precision on benchmark datasets.

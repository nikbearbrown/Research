# Requirements Document: Citation Checker for LLM Validation
Currently working on this: **Lawrence Swaminathan Xavier Prince, Aravind Balaji**
## 1. Executive Summary

The Citation Checker is a specialized tool designed to verify references and citations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). It serves as both a practical validation tool and an educational example for the "Data Validation Techniques for AI Systems" module in a computational skepticism course. The tool aims to address the philosophical question of truth and falsifiability in AI-generated content while providing practical mechanisms to verify claims against their purported sources. This project will be completed within an 8-week timeframe.

## 2. Project Scope

### 2.1 Purpose
To develop a robust system that verifies the accuracy and authenticity of citations and references produced by LLMs by cross-checking them against original source materials.

### 2.2 Objectives
- Validate the existence of cited sources
- Verify the accuracy of quoted content against original sources
- Detect hallucinations or fabricated references
- Provide confidence scores for citation accuracy
- Generate detailed reports on citation validity
- Serve as an educational tool demonstrating practical applications of computational skepticism

## 3. System Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

  - In-text citations (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.)
  - Footnotes and endnotes
  - Hyperlinks
  - Bibliographic entries
  - Custom citation formats used by specific LLMs (e.g., Claude's citation tags)

#### 3.1.2 Source Retrieval
- The system must locate and access original source materials through:
  - Web crawling for online sources
  - Academic database APIs (Google Scholar, PubMed, JSTOR, etc.)
  - Book content databases (Google Books, Open Library)
  - Local document repositories
  - Paywalled content access mechanisms (where legally permissible)

#### 3.1.3 Content Verification
- The system must verify:
  - Existence of the cited source
  - Presence of quoted content within the source
  - Semantic similarity between quoted content and original text
  - Contextual accuracy of paraphrased content
  - Accuracy of attributions to authors or speakers
  - Temporal validity of citations (e.g., ensuring citations don't reference future publications)

#### 3.1.4 Analysis and Reporting
- Generate detailed reports including:
  - Validity score for each citation (0-100%)

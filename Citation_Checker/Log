**Email from Prof. Sri:**

here are some points below that constitute a solid research project on citation checking.
define what is a citation
Describe textual details of a citation. Is the DOI enough to uniquely identify citations. What about citations that do not have a DOI.
define accuracy of a citation
why is the accuracy of a citation important
Note that citation accuracy has to be 100%. Any errors are not tolerable.
What are the characteristics of a citation checker
assessment of available citation checkers
make a sample database. Get 500 accurate citations. Then make another 500 by corrupting accurate citations.
Use this 1000 citation database to check the accuracy of the citation checker.
Define metrics for assessing accuracy off a citation checker.
Coding for your own citation checker

The role of software like Endnote, Mendeley, etc should also be looked into.

    "answer": "Step 1: Lever arm (moment arm) = perpendicular distance from pivot to the force’s line of action = r sinθ, where r = |r| and θ is the angle between r and F.\n\nStep 2: Since 0 ≤ sinθ ≤ 1, we have r sinθ ≤ r.\n\nStep 3: Therefore |r| can never be less than the lever arm (r < r sinθ is impossible). Equality occurs only when sinθ = 1 → θ = 90°.\n\nFinal answer: |r| cannot be less than the lever arm; it can be equal only when θ = 90°."

(b) If the 50-N force is replaced by a 50-N weight, what is the angular velocity of the cylinder after 6.0 m of cord have unwound?",
    "modified_question_solution": "Given:\nRadius R = 0.30 m\nMoment of inertia I = 8.0 kg·m²\nForce F = 50 N\nLength of cord s = 6.0 m\n\n**(a) With a constant 50 N force:**\nWe use the work-energy theorem: W = ΔK.\nThe work done by the force is W = F * s.\nThe change in kinetic energy is ΔK = 1/2 * I * ω² (starting from rest).\nF * s = 1/2 * I * ω²\nω = sqrt(2 * F * s / I)\nω = sqrt(2 * 50 N * 6.0 m / 8.0 kg·m²) ≈ 8.66 rad/s\n\n**(b) With a 50 N weight:**\nWe use conservation of mechanical energy. The loss in the weight's potential energy (ΔU) is converted into the kinetic energy of the weight (K_weight) and the rotational kinetic energy of the cylinder (K_cyl).\nFirst, find the mass of the weight: m = F/g = 50 N / 9.8 m/s² ≈ 5.102 kg.\nThe weight falls a height h = s = 6.0 m.\nΔU = mgh\nK_total = K_weight + K_cyl = 1/2*m*v² + 1/2*I*ω²\nSince v = Rω, the equation becomes:\nmgh = 1/2*m*(Rω)² + 1/2*I*ω² = 1/2 * (mR² + I) * ω²\nSolving for ω:\nω = sqrt(2mgh / (mR² + I))\nω = sqrt(2 * 5.102 * 9.8 * 6.0 / (5.102 * 0.30² + 8.0)) ≈ 8.41 rad/s"

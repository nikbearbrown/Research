# Agentic AI: Causal Reasoning, Trust and Hypothesis Generation

This folder contains three research papers exploring different aspects of agentic AI systems, with a focus on challenges and specialized applications.

## Contents

### 1. [The Opacity Problem: Trust, Explainability, and Verification Challenges in Multi-Agent AI Systems](trust-explainability-verification.md)

This paper examines the fundamental challenges of ensuring transparency and verifiability in multi-agent AI architectures. It introduces the concept of "compounded opacity" - the multiplicative complexity that emerges when multiple AI systems interact through loosely defined communication protocols.

**Key contributions:**
- Analysis of structural sources of opacity in multi-agent systems (distributed memory, asynchronous communication)
- Case studies across healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and financial trading showing real-world implications
- Review of current explainability approaches and their limitations
- Proposed research agenda addressing causal traceability, verification methodologies, and governance frameworks

### 2. [The Causal Reasoning Gap in Modern AI Agents](causal-reasoning-research.md)

This paper examines the critical limitation of current AI systems regarding causal understanding and reasoning. It demonstrates how LLM-based systems excel at pattern recognition but fail to grasp genuine cause-effect relationships.

**Key contributions:**
- Analysis of causal reasoning through Pearl's hierarchy (association, intervention, counterfactuals)
- Empirical evidence of causal reasoning failures across healthcare, autonomous driving, and finance
- Case studies illustrating how lack of causal understanding leads to brittleness in real-world deployments
- Survey of emerging approaches including causal representation learning and neuro-symbolic architectures

### 3. [CANCER-COGNITOME: An Interdisciplinary Framework of AI Agents for Hypothesis Generation](cancer-ai-research.md)

This paper presents a specialized application of multi-agent AI systems to cancer research. It introduces CANCER-COGNITOME, a framework designed to collaborate with human researchers to generate novel cancer research hypotheses and design experimental validation plans.

**Key contributions:**
- Multi-agent architecture with specialized agents covering molecular biology, clinical oncology, and experimental design
- Collaborative hypothesis generation methodology with human-in-the-loop guidance
- Experimental design component translating hypotheses into concrete validation plans
- Case studies on pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and Barrett's esophagus progression
- Evaluation framework for assessing hypothesis quality and human-AI collaboration

## Common Themes

These papers collectively highlight several important themes in agentic AI research:

1. **The Limitations of Current AI Architectures**: Both the opacity and causal reasoning papers identify fundamental constraints in today's AI systems that limit their reliability in dynamic, real-world environments.

2. **Multi-Agent Coordination Challenges**: The papers explore how coordination between specialized AI agents introduces both new capabilities and new complexities.

3. **Human-AI Collaboration Models**: Particularly evident in the CANCER-COGNITOME paper, there's a focus on how humans and AI systems can work together effectively, with each contributing complementary strengths.

4. **Safety and Trustworthiness Concerns**: All three papers address the need for robust safety mechanisms, transparent explanations, and verification capabilities before deploying agentic systems in high-stakes domains.

5. **Research Agendas for Future Work**: Each paper outlines specific research priorities to address current limitations and advance the field.

## Relevance to Practitioners

These papers provide valuable insights for different stakeholders:

- **AI Researchers**: Identification of fundamental challenges that require novel technical approaches
- **Domain Experts**: Frameworks for effectively collaborating with AI systems (particularly in scientific discovery)
- **System Designers**: Architectural considerations for building more transparent and robust multi-agent systems
- **Policy Makers**: Understanding of verification and governance challenges that need addressing

The collection highlights both the significant potential of agentic AI systems and the substantial technical and ethical challenges that must be overcome before their safe deployment in critical domains.

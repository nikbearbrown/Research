## Introduction

## Image Enhancement and Denoising

Generative AI, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has shown significant potential in enhancing electron microscopy images. Alam (2021) and Fuentes-Hurtado (2023) both demonstrate the effectiveness of GAN-based super-resolution and denoising algorithms in improving the quality of these images. Song (2020) and Guo (2019) further advance these techniques by proposing improved training methods and models that can generate high-resolution images with sharper details. Zhang (2019) and Kusters (2021) extend the application of GANs to high-throughput and low-dose CT image denoising, respectively, while Kushwaha (2022) provides an overview of the use of GANs in super-image resolution. Anada (2023) highlights the potential of mathematical and machine learning-based denoising techniques, which can be further explored in the context of electron microscopy.

### Super-Resolution Enhancement Methods

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as powerful tools for enhancing the resolution of microscopy images. A notable contribution in this field is by Alam et al. (2021), who proposed a GAN-based super-resolution algorithm designed to enhance the resolution of integral imaging microscopy images. This approach involves directly feeding the directional view image into the GAN, resulting in significantly improved resolution compared to existing algorithms. The quantitative analysis demonstrated superior performance of the proposed model for microscopic images, effectively addressing the low-resolution problem caused by the fundamental limitations of the microlens array and poor illumination environment .

In another study, Alam et al. (2020) further explored the potential of GANs for microscopy by proposing a deep learning-based method that enhances the resolution of integral imaging microscopy using a generative adversarial network. This method captures elemental images through a microlens array to generate orthographic view images, effectively improving the resolution through the GAN framework. This advancement underscores the versatility of GANs in overcoming hardware limitations and enhancing image quality .

### Denoising Techniques

Generative adversarial networks are also being leveraged for denoising microscopy images. Fuentes-Hurtado et al. (2023) introduced a novel framework for few-shot microscopy image denoising using a GAN trained via contrastive learning and structure-preserving loss terms. This method significantly advances microscopy image analysis by reducing the amount of training data needed while maintaining the quality of denoising. The framework can be extended to other image restoration tasks, demonstrating its versatility and potential impact on the field .

Chen and Stanley (2020) proposed a GAN-based method specifically for denoising electron microscope images. Their approach involves training a GAN to generate realistic microscope images, which are then optimized over the latent space to find a clean image resembling the noisy input. This method addresses the inherent noise issues in electron microscopy, facilitating better scientific analysis by improving the clarity and accuracy of the images .

### Resolution Enhancement in Specific Imaging Modalities

Several studies have applied GANs to enhance resolution in specific imaging modalities. For instance, Zhang et al. (2019) combined GANs with light microscopy to achieve deep learning super-resolution under a large field of view. This method enhances the resolution of conventional optical microscopes without the need for additional hardware or multiple frames, transforming them into high-resolution systems capable of detailed imaging. This approach demonstrates the broad applicability of GANs in improving various types of microscopy techniques .

Similarly, Kushwaha et al. (2022) reviewed the use of the Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) approach to convert low-resolution images to high-resolution images. This technique processes low-resolution inputs through the SRGAN to produce high-resolution outputs, demonstrating its efficacy in image enhancement and its potential to significantly impact various scientific fields that rely on high-resolution imaging .

### Section Summary
